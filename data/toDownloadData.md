# how to know which data to download

### First

I went on this website: https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/Hospital-Inpatient-Discharges-SPARCS-De-Identified/82xm-y6g8 and exported as CSV

### Second

I went on this website: https://www.neighborhoodatlas.medicine.wisc.edu/ and registered using my .edu email.

Then under 'Download Data' I chose the following options for 'Download the ADI Rankings':

Choose Linkage Format: 9-digit zipcode
Choose State(s) for Download: Single State: New York
Choose Version: 2015

After downloading provided zip file, I changed the extension from .txt to .csv to make a csv file
